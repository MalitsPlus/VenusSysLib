# VenusSysLib

[**hoshimi-venus**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hoshimi-venus) (project name: **VenusSysLib**) is a common Node.js library used for simulating in-game Live.

## Request for information

This project is still under development and is expected to be in that state for a long turn.

The ultimate goal of this project is to achive a **completely reliable** live simulation library which's outputs are completely match in-game live results. For the sake of that, to ensure outputs are completely reliable, a large amount of comparative experiments are indispensable during the whole development lifecycle. Even if I will do that at a slow pace it still would be difficult to cover all the situations. That said, **your** help is crucial for this purpose.  
Welcome to commit issues if you find any incorrect results while using this library.
