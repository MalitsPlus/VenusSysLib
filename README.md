## Request for information

This project is still under development and is expected to be in that state for a long time.

The ultimate goal of this project is to achive a **completely reliable** live simulation library which's outputs are completely match in-game live results. For the sake of that, to ensure its outputs are completely reliable, a large amount of comparative experiments are indispensable during the development. Even if I will do that at a slow pace it still would be difficult to cover all the situations. That said, **your** voices are crucial for this purpose.  
Please feel free to commit a issue if you find any incorrect results while using this library.
